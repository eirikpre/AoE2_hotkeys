# Age of Empires 2 Hotkeys

A set of modified hotkeys for AoE2 based on the default hotkeys from the Definitive Edition. The main feature of these hotkeys are that they **feel natural** and are **fast to learn**! They extend the default (DE) hotkeys, but keep the changes small in comparison to some other hotkey sets. If you are looking for the complete opposite, hard to learn but designed for hyper-efficiency, check out Nili's hotkeys.

The Definitive Edition changes the most of the hotkeys to a grid based system compared to its predecessors. The new grid is great, but it does only apply to the commands of a selected entity. _Eg. villager build menu, building options, unit stances and formation._ 

The grid consist of:
- QWERT
- ASDFG
- ZXCVB

The grid does not apply to the rest of the hotkeys, such as select buildings and go to entities. The default hotkeys for these did not come natural, thus these hotkeys exist. A couple of common rules make these hotkeys work well together.
- Letters in the grid are not used without modifiers
- Letters outside the grid may be used without modifiers
- Only 1 modifier key used at a time

Also, if you are like me and get a sore pinky with extended Ctrl'ing on a QWERTY keyboard, do yourself a favor, use CapsLock as Control! My AutoHotkey script can be found here: [capslock-control.ahk](https://gist.github.com/eirikpre/eb39bdd90fa719db7ea06338a9d9b919)

There are two sets provided in this repository, that function differently, and most likely play differently.
- `select_all` for those that like selecting all without changing camera.
- `cycle` for those that like cycling building and have the camera move often
