## Game Commands
These commands relative to their function (eco or military), and their place in the building grid.

## Cycle Commands
Cycle commands are what makes this hard to do. Cycle commands also double up as camera hotkeys. 
One can put these ontop of the same grid as explained before, with a different modifer. However, using the same grid is not great, because if you want to cycle then build, you will have to wait for the modifier key press to release before building, which might not happen if you have to perform actions rapidly. The solution is to use the *other* grid, which has the great benefit of not overlapping with any other functionality, aka not needing modifier keys!

- YUIOP
- HJKL
- BNM,.

H per default is Go to Town Center, so that sets a great starting point. Then to employ as little hand movement as possible we have to look at priority. First priority is camera, here snapping to villager areas, or the front would be of interest. The next is to look at what you might cycle to for building or researching. With these two in mind, one can see that H (Town Center) is scoring high on both, and that fits quite well with it being one of the closest keys to the original grid. *Eg. One can easily press H->Q to build a villager with **one hand***.

| Command                       | Hotkey     |
|-------------------------------|------------|
| Go to Castle                  | Y          | <!-- First Row -->
| Go to Barracks                | U          |
| Go to Archery Range           | I          |
| Go to Stable                  | O          |
| Go to Siege Workshop          | P          |
| Go to Town Center             | H          | <!-- Second Row -->
| Go to Blacksmith              | J          |
| Go to Market                  | K          |
| Go to Monastery               | L          | 
| Go to Lumber Camp             | B          | <!-- Third Row -->
| Go to Mining Camp             | N          |
| Go to Mill                    | M          |
| Go to Next Idle Villager      | ,          |
| Go to Next Idle Military      | .          |

As you can see, Town Center and Castle got the closest positions. Castle where changed to be first in line of the military building ordered according to the grid on the top row, and dock is moved below. The second row is identical to the grid above, except it is missing *Go to University* which I deem not necessary.
The third row is your bread and butter to villager navigation, containing all drop off points and idles.

This leaves some important things out, which would be where you would be most likely to add your own twist.

Ring Town Bell changed from B to V to open the B

## Gate Commands
Changed rotate gate to R and counter-clockwise rotate to E.


## Settings / Camera / UI / Misc
As you might have noticed, the *Alt*-key modifier has been left untouched. This is because it most likely locks thumb. If you are using your pinky on the Alt-key, these hotkeys might make less sense for you.
